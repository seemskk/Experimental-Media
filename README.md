# Experimental Media
**Prof. Jay Menon and Seema Krishnakumar**

The repository puts together the student work from **Experimental Media** course for 4th year UG Communication Design and 2nd year PG Communication Design conducted at DJ Academy of Design, Coimbatore from 2014 - 18. The course was developed over this four year period. Some snippets of the selected works are featured from the early years.

The course when it started allowed students to choose random themes. Eventually from 2015, a common theme was suggested as a trigger to produce their output. The students were encouraged to create more participatory installations. The course outcome turned out robust and abstract over the years as was originally intended. 

The objective of the course is to explore unconventional /mixed/ alternative techniques to create a meaningful communication that engages the viewer in a more active and more thoughtful relationship.

The 4 week module is a process oriented course that takes through the concept - storyboard - execution - digitising/ presenation stages.
